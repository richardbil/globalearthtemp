# Global Earth Temperature Data Analysis

So this is basically just some playing around, there is no claim to meet demands to completeness or scientific rigor or whatever else, just tbh.
There are also no standarts here to satisfy any demands for readibility or anything else that brings comfort to hypothetical reades, so.. 

## The Data: 

Got it from Kaggle, basically just Temperature Data Worldwide as conclusive as possible, dating back to 1750s, with monthly averages. 

## What we want to do:

1. We'd like to do some simple analysis
	1. deleting Countrys with too much Missing Data
	2. Sorting the Countrys after biggest Change in Yearly Averages and visualizing it somehow 
	3.
